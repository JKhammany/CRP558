<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello, my name is <Jasmine Khammany/p> and I am a Senior in Community and Regional Planning. I also have minors in GIS and Sociology. My interests in planning focus on social equity and housing issues but I do enjoy doing spatial analysis that pertain to social aspects of demography. In my freetime, I enjoy writing, painting, listening to music, and spending time with friends.
