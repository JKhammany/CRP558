<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Jasmine Khammany and I am a Senior in Community and Regional Planning. I also have minors in GIS and Sociology. Currently, I work as an intern at the City of Grimes. My ultimate goal at the end of graduation is to have aquired a position as a planner in any city around the U.S. but my top picks would be in Colorado or Florida as of right now. My interests in planning focus on social equity and housing issues but I do enjoy doing spatial analysis that pertain to social aspects of demography. In my freetime, I enjoy writing, painting, listening to music, and spending time with friends. </p>
