<h1 style="font-size: 30">A Home for Homeless by Akuto Konou</h1>

<p style="font-size:20;""margin-left: 100px">I liked that your project related to the current climate of today's world. Homelessness is a big topic to cover and not only is it interesting to study but it's very important to figure out. I liked that you chose a semi-out-of-the-box topic of relating COVID19 and its impact on this marginalized community. I also loved the beginning photo slide you included because the design and placement made it look professionally done. Breaking up the word segments with visual elements was very nice for your organizational design. Also, the inclusion of french translation was a nice touch for your viewer audience. Overall design, structure, and content is mature and professional. I really enjoyed your first map the most because the colors that you used and the different elements made it aesthetically pleasing. Your project is very easy to read, extremely interactive, and explains context very well.</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size:20;""margin-left: 100px">Some really cool element that you included in your project that I didn't necessarily know about is the stationary photos while scrolling the page. It adds a nice visual effect that I didn't realize we could do because I was only familiar with that sort of function in GIS Story Maps. The graph functions were really nice, but I was wondering if there were any more design options for those or if that is all you can do to make it look a little more appealing. I also didn't realize that timeline maps were possible either. I still question whether or not you can customize the data that pops up at the bottom of the map. It's also really cool that you included an interactive crowdmap for people to participate in the survey. I found it interesting that you are involved in this study and data collection and is interesting to find out about the complications that have occured when collecting input. I wouldn't have thought about people not wanting to participate because of the threat of COVID19.</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size:20;""margin-left: 100px">I think that something that could be worked on is the last segment of innovation. I feel like it doesn't relate very well to homelessness, but if it were reworded more to emphasize something like "urban agriculture is a tool used to empower the homeless" that it would resonate a whole lot better with the entirety of the project. If you highlight the subject around homelessness and then talk about the study of urban agriculture and its background details or history it would bring attention more to the homelessness portion rather than leaving it in the last sentence. I also think it would have been cool if you made two separate pages for english and french and had a button that would take you to the other page if you needed translation. I just feel like having both is a little too much for my eyes to look at and realize I can't read the other side very well. Even something like shaded boxes might help distinguish the different languages a little bit easier. A bold dividing line in between the two languages would even work.</p>
