<h1 style="font-size: 30">ArcGIS Javascript API by Kelsey Van Selous</h1>

<p style="font-size: 20">I really liked your overall design of the report page because it is very precise and clear with the way you split it up into sections. The report in my opinion looks clean and organized. I really appreciated that you wrote step-by-step instructions to follow along with because it makes it easier for the readers to follow and be engaged with. I also really enjoy that you have embedded links and an additional section for references and additional resources because it appears that you put a lot of time and thought into your report. It also makes it look professional and like you did your research to help others that want to learn more. The headings and subsections make your report really easy to follow and read and I like that your map is placed in between paragraphs to split up the content. I also appreciate that you described the level of user usability because that is extremely helpful to know. The content that you chose seems like something more complex which makes the report interesting for your readers.</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size: 20">I think something that would help your report visually is making the headings and subheadings bigger so readers can more easily digest what section they are reading into and easily navigate your report. Also, in places where the report is text heavy, some pictures that supplement your writing would help break up your report and create visual aids for your readers to further understand your content. It would be cool to see other examples like how you described that weather apps and air fare apps use API. Explaining how other people or companies use it in things that we as users see often and interact with would be an interesting addition to your writing. Also, if the shapes that you have in your mapping can be 3D renderings through Javascript API, like if that function is easy enough to do, it would really add to your map visually and really engage the readers.</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size: 20">I do agree that ArcGIS Javascript API makes mapping content more interactive for users. This would be useful to me in situations where I would like to display 3D aspects. I also do appreciate that it offers more complex detailing and functions than others. This could apply to projects such as if I were to map out building footprints for communities that are prone to flooding. I could look into housing that is at elevations at risk of being flooded and map them by distinguishing them in different colors or however I wanted to display that information. I could look even further into social demographics like income and further display that information in different ways.</p>
